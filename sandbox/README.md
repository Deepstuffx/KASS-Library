# Sandbox

Synthetic / placeholder data for development & testing.

## Structure
```
fake_packs/
  clean/   # Simulated already well-organized samples
  messy/   # Simulated disorganized samples for scanner tests
```

## Usage Ideas
- Place small WAV/AIFF files here to test scanning.
- Add intentionally duplicated filenames in `messy/` for conflict handling.
- Later: add synthetic preset folders for Phase Seven.

## Not Production Data
Everything in this directory is disposable. No assumptions about permanence.
